# GitOps For Your Pipelines

In this blog post we're going to cover how to use git and Concourse to automatically set, update, and archive your pipelines using the [`set_pipeline`](https://concourse-ci.org/set-pipeline-step.html) step. No longer will you need to use `fly set-pipeline` to update any of your pipelines!

For consistency we will refer to the pipeline that contains all the [`set_pipeline`](https://concourse-ci.org/set-pipeline-step.html) steps as the **parent pipeline**. The pipelines created by the `set_pipeline` steps will be called **child pipelines**.

_Scroll to the bottom to see the final pipeline template or [click here](https://github.com/concourse/examples/blob/master/pipelines/set-pipelines.yml). What follows is a detailed explanation of how the parent pipeline works along with git and automatic archiving._

## Prerequisite

To run the pipelines in this blog post for yourself you can get your own Concourse running locally by following the [Quick Start guide](https://concourse-ci.org/quick-start.html).

You will also need to fork the [github.com/concourse/examples](https://github.com/concourse/examples) repo and replace `USERNAME` with your github username in the below examples. We will continue to refer to the repo as `concourse/examples`. Once you have forked the repo clone it locally onto your machine and `cd` into the repo.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/examples.git
$ cd examples
```

## Create the Parent Pipeline

Inside your fork of `concourse/examples` that you have cloned locally, create a file named `reconfigure-pipelines.yml` inside the `pipelines` folder. This is the pipeline that we are going to be building. We will refer to this pipeline as the _parent pipeline_.

```
$ touch ./pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yml
```

Like the `fly set-pipeline` command, the `set_pipeline` step needs a YAML file containing a pipeline configuration. We will use the [concourse/examples](https://github.com/concourse/examples) repo as the place to store our pipelines and thankfully it already contains many pipelines! Let's add the repo as a resource to our parent pipeline.

```yaml
resources:
- name: concourse-examples
  type: git
  icon: github
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:USERNAME/examples.git
```

Now we will add a job that will set our pipelines. The first step in the job will fetch the `concourse/examples` repo, making it available to future steps as the `concourse-examples` artifact. We will also add the `trigger` parameter to ensure that the job will run whenever a new commit is pushed to the `concourse/examples` repo.

```yaml
resources:
- name: concourse-examples
  type: git
  icon: github
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:USERNAME/examples.git

jobs:
- name: configure-pipelines
  public: true
  plan:
    - get: concourse-examples
      trigger: true
```

Next we will add the `set_pipeline` step to set one of the pipelines in the `concourse/examples` repo. We will set the `hello-world` pipeline first.

```yaml
resources:
- name: concourse-examples
  type: git
  icon: github
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:USERNAME/examples.git

jobs:
- name: configure-pipelines
  public: true
  plan:
    - get: concourse-examples
      trigger: true
    - set_pipeline: hello-world
      file: concourse-examples/pipelines/hello-world.yml
```

Let's commit what we have so far and push it to github.

```bash
$ git add pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yml
$ git commit -m "add reconfigure-pipelines"
$ git push -u origin head
```

## Setting the Parent Pipeline

Now we have a [chicken or the egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg) problem, except in this case we know our parent pipeline comes first! Let's set our pipeline with `fly` and execute the `configure-pipelines` job.

```bash
$ fly -t local set-pipeline -p reconfigure-pipelines -c pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yaml
...
apply configuration? [yN]: y

$ fly -t local unpause-pipeline -p reconfigure-pipelines
unpaused 'reconfigure-pipelines'

$ fly -t local trigger-job -j reconfigure-pipelines/configure-pipelines --watch
```

Once the job is done running you should see two pipelines, `reconfigure-pipelines` and `hello-world`.

Now any changes you make to the `hello-world` pipeline will be updated automatically in Concourse once it picks up the commit with your changes.

## Detour: The Future of Setting Parent Pipelines

Currently under discussion is [RFC 32: Projects](https://github.com/concourse/rfcs/pull/32/). One if it's core motivations is:

> Smoothen the learning curve. Right now the jump from fly execute to fly set-pipeline is pretty steep...

Currently, as of Concourse 6.5.0, the only way to create a pipeline is:
* `fly set-pipeline` or
*  `set_pipeline` step in a pipeline that you have to first `fly set-pipeline` with...

If [RFC 32](https://github.com/concourse/rfcs/pull/32/) is implemented as currently described then you won't have to ever use `fly set-pipeline` to create pipelines, you'll simply create a **Project**, which involves pointing Concourse to a repo where you code lives. In the proposed `project.yml` you can then define all of your pipelines with `set_pipeline` steps. You'll end up with an even cleaner GitOps flow than what's currently possible.

The [RFC is still open](https://github.com/concourse/rfcs/pull/32) and looking for feedback. Check out the PR and leave your thoughts for the community to discuss!

Now let's get back on track and talk about how to automatically set that parent pipeline.

## Pipelines Setting Themselves

Our parent pipeline is setting and updating one other pipeline now but it has one glaring limitation: it doesn't set itself. We have to `fly set-pipeline` every time we want to add a new pipeline to the `configure-pipelines` job.

To resolve this we can do the following to our parent pipeline:
* Add a job **before** the `configure-pipelines` job that self-updates the parent pipeline. We'll name the job `configure-self`.
* Add a `passed` constraint to the `configure-pipelines` job to only run once the `concourse-examples` resource has passed the new `configure-self` job.

By doing the above we will never have to use `fly` to update the parent pipline again. Every commit to the `concourse/examples` repo will cause the parent pipeline to update itself and then all of its child pipelines. Now our pipelines are following a GitOps type of workflow!

Here is what the above changes look like when implemented:

```yaml
resources:
- name: concourse-examples
  type: git
  icon: github
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:USERNAME/examples.git

jobs:
- name: configure-self
  plan:
  - get: concourse-examples
    trigger: true
  - set_pipeline: reconfigure-pipelines
    file: concourse-examples/pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yml
- name: configure-pipelines
  plan:
  - get: concourse-examples
    trigger: true
    passed: [configure-self]
  - set_pipeline: hello-world
    file: concourse-examples/pipelines/hello-world.yml
```

**Side-note**: for the `configure-self` job, you could also use the [`self` keyword](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#schema.step.set-pipeline-step.set_pipeline), though this is labelled as experimental and may disappear in the future.

Lets set the parent pipeline one more time with `fly` and then we'll make commits to the repo to make all future changes.

```bash
$ fly -t local set-pipeline -p reconfigure-pipelines -c pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yaml
...
apply configuration? [yN]: y
```

The parent pipeline should now look like this. Now the pipeline will first update itself and then update any existing child pipelines.

![parent pipeline with config-self job](set-self.png)

Let's commit our changes, which will be a no-op since we've already updated the pipeline with the latest changes.
```bash
$ git add pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yml
$ git commit -m "add configure-self job"
$ git push
```

Now comes the real fun! To add a pipeline to Concourse all we need to do is add a `set_pipeline` step to the parent pipeline, commit it to the `concourse/examples` repo, and let the parent pipeline pick up the new commit and make the changes for us.

Lets add the `time-triggered` pipeline to our `reconfigure-pipelines.yml` file.

```yaml
resources:
- name: concourse-examples
  type: git
  icon: github
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:USERNAME/examples.git

jobs:
- name: configure-self
  plan:
  - get: concourse-examples
    trigger: true
  - set_pipeline: reconfigure-pipelines
    file: concourse-examples/pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yml
- name: configure-pipelines
  plan:
  - get: concourse-examples
    trigger: true
    passed: [configure-self]
  - set_pipeline: hello-world
    file: concourse-examples/pipelines/hello-world.yml
  - set_pipeline: time-triggered
    file: concourse-examples/pipelines/time-triggered.yml
```

Commit and push the changes to github.
```bash
$ git add pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yml
$ git commit -m "add time-triggered pipeline"
$ git push
```

Once Concourse picks up the commit (may take up to a minute by default) you should see three pipelines on the dashboard. Now you never need to use `fly` to set pipelines!

## Automatically Archiving Pipelines

Having Concourse automatically set pipelines for you is great but that only covers half of the lifecycle that a pipeline can go through. Some pipelines stay around forever and get continously updated. Other pipelines may only be around for a small amount of time and then be deleted or archived.

Thanks to [RFC #33](https://github.com/concourse/rfcs/pull/33) you can now archive pipelines and have Concourse **automatically archive** pipelines for you as well. You've been able to archive pipelines using `fly` since Concourse 6.1.0. Automatic archiving was added in 6.5.0.

A pipeline will only be considered for automatic archiving if it was previously set by a `set_pipeline` step. It will be archived if one of the following is true:
* the `set_pipeline` step is removed from the job
* the job that was setting the child pipeline is deleted
* the parent pipeline is deleted or archived

We can test this out with the parent pipeline we were just using. Let's remove the `hello-world` pipeline.

```yaml
resources:
- name: concourse-examples
  type: git
  icon: github
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:USERNAME/examples.git

jobs:
- name: configure-self
  plan:
  - get: concourse-examples
    trigger: true
  - set_pipeline: reconfigure-pipelines
    file: concourse-examples/pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yml
- name: configure-pipelines
  plan:
  - get: concourse-examples
    trigger: true
    passed: [configure-self]
  - set_pipeline: time-triggered
    file: concourse-examples/pipelines/time-triggered.yml
```

Commit and push the changes to github.
```bash
$ git add pipelines/reconfigure-pipelines.yml
$ git commit -m "remove hello-world pipeline"
$ git push
```

After a few seconds the pipeline should disappear from the dashboard (unless you toggle "show archived" on).

With automatic archiving the entire lifecycle of your pipelines can now be managed with a git repo and a few commits.

I suggest checking out the documentation for [`set_pipeline`](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#schema.step.set-pipeline-step.set_pipeline) to see all the other fields available for the step, like `team` and `vars`!

## The Parent Pipeline Template (tl;dr)

```yaml
resources:
- name: ci
  type: git
  icon: github
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:USERNAME/repo-where-pipelines-live.git

jobs:
- name: configure-self
  plan:
  - get: ci
    trigger: true
  - set_pipeline: self
    file: ci/path/to/parent-pipeline.yml
- name: configure-pipelines
  plan:
  - get: ci
    trigger: true
    passed: [configure-self]
  - set_pipeline: some-pipeline
    file: ci/path/to/some-pipeline.yml
  - set_pipeline: another-pipeline
    file: ci/path/to/another-pipeline.yml
```
